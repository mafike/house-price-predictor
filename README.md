# üè† House Price Predictor ‚Äì An MLOps Learning Project

Welcome to the **House Price Predictor** project. An end-to-end, real-world MLOps learning use case. The goal is to practice building and operationalizing a complete ML pipeline from raw data to deployable models.
You‚Äôll move through data preprocessing, feature engineering, experimentation, and model tracking with MLflow, with the option to explore interactively in Jupyter all using industry-standard tooling and workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up Learning/Development Environment

Install the following tools:

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred editor
- [UV ‚Äì Python package and environment manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) **or** [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/)

---

## üöÄ Preparing Your Environment

1. **Fork this repo** on GitHub.

2. **Clone your forked copy:**

   ```bash
   # Replace xxxxxx with your GitHub username or org
   git clone https://github.com/xxxxxx/house-price-predictor.git
   cd house-price-predictor
   ```

3. **Setup Python Virtual Environment using UV:**

   ```bash
   uv venv --python python3.11
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## üìä Setup MLflow for Experiment Tracking

Start MLflow locally to track experiments and model runs:

```bash
cd deployment/mlflow
docker compose -f mlflow-docker-compose.yml up -d
docker compose ps
```

> üêß **Using Podman?** Use this instead:

```bash
podman compose -f mlflow-docker-compose.yml up -d
podman compose ps
```

Access the MLflow UI at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)

---

## üìí Using JupyterLab (Optional)

If you prefer an interactive experience, launch JupyterLab with:

```bash
uv python -m jupyterlab
# or
python -m jupyterlab
```

---

## üîÅ Model Workflow

### üßπ Step 1: Data Processing

Clean and preprocess the raw housing dataset:

```bash
python src/data/run_processing.py   --input data/raw/house_data.csv   --output data/processed/cleaned_house_data.csv
```

---

### üß† Step 2: Feature Engineering

Apply transformations and generate features:

```bash
python src/features/engineer.py   --input data/processed/cleaned_house_data.csv   --output data/processed/featured_house_data.csv   --preprocessor models/trained/preprocessor.pkl
```

---

### üìà Step 3: Modeling & Experimentation

Train your model and log everything to MLflow:

```bash
python src/models/train_model.py   --config configs/model_config.yaml   --data data/processed/featured_house_data.csv   --models-dir models   --mlflow-tracking-uri http://localhost:5555
```

## Building FastAPI and Streamlit 

The code for both the apps are available in `src/api` and `streamlit_app` already. To build and launch these apps 

  * Add a  `Dockerfile` in the root of the source code for building FastAPI  
  * Add `streamlit_app/Dockerfile` to package and build the Streamlit app  
  * Add `docker-compose.yaml` in the root path to launch both these apps. be sure to provide `API_URL=http://fastapi:8000` in the streamlit app's environment. 


Once you have launched both the apps, you should be able to access streamlit web ui and make predictions. 

You could also test predictions with FastAPI directly using 

```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "sqft": 1500,
  "bedrooms": 3,
  "bathrooms": 2,
  "location": "suburban",
  "year_built": 2000,
  "condition": fair
}'

```

Be sure to replace `http://localhost:8000/predict` with actual endpoint based on where its running. 

## üéØ Key Learning Outcomes
* Applying MLOps best practices in a structured project
* Using MLflow to track experiments, metrics, and models
* Packaging and deploying ML services with FastAPI + Streamlit
* Leveraging Docker Compose for reproducible environments
* Demonstrating how raw data becomes a production-ready ML application
